 Handwritten Digit Generator using GANs

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic handwritten digits using the  dataset. It features a CNN-based Generator and Discriminator trained adversarially, with image outputs and training loss visualized throughout the process.


 Features

-  Custom-built CNN Generator and Discriminator
-  Trained using TensorFlow's `GradientTape` API for full control
-  Tracks and plots generator/discriminator losses
-  Generates and saves synthetic digit images every 10 epochs
-  Supports model weight saving and loading



Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- MNIST Dataset
